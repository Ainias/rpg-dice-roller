# dice-roller

A basic JS based dice roller that accepts typical dice notation.


## Supported notation

The standard notation formats are accepted, such as `2d6+12`, and also the use of `L` or `H` to represent the lowest or highest roll respectively.  
ie. `4d6-L` (A roll of 4 six-sided dice, dropping the lowest result)


### Operators

You can also use multiply and divide mathematical operators; `1d6*5` or `2d10/d20`.  
However, the use of the mathematical symbols `ร` and `รท` do not currently work, but are planned.


### Percentile dice (d%)

Although percentile dice can be rolled by using a `d100`, you can also use `d%`, which will do the same thing, returning a number between 0 and 100.


## Browsers

This dice roller only works on the latest browsers and will **not** work in versions of IE older than 10.

## Usage

You only need to include the `dice-roller.js` file in your project:

```<script src="dice-roller.js"></script>```

You can use `DiceRoller` like so:

```
<script>
  // create a new instance of the DiceRoller
  var diceRoller  = new DiceRoller();

  // roll the dice
  diceRoller.roll('4d20-L');
  
  // get the latest dice rolls from the log
  var latestRoll  = diceRoller.getLog().shift();
  
  // output the latest roll - it has a toString method for nice output
  document.write(latestRoll);
</script>
```
